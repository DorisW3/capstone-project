# Welcome to my Capstone Project!! ðŸŽ‰
For my capstone project I created a little mobile app, which can be viewed best in iPhone-XR-view. The project can be looked at on the following vercel link: https://capstone-project-dorisw3.vercel.app/favorites (username: dolorisi, password: firstApp09.23)

## Art Connect - Kunst, die verbindet

This app is for ( amateur ) artists who want to expand their network!
Here they can post their artwork, like the artwork of other users, leave comments under a picture and follow artists they like. Therefore, the user can see all their own images on one page, where he also can upload images with additional information.
<br><br>

Below the login page and the gallery page with images of various users can be seen:

<br><br><br>

Clicking one picture guides to the details page, where the chosen image is shown with some further information. Among them is a comment feature, where users can write and read comments about the picture:

On the user page, all own images are listed and there also is an image upload feature. The favorites page displays all liked pictures.
